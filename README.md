# TodaCorrelation
Python file to compute the correlation functions of the Toda lattice, used in on ongoing scientific project.

There are two different files that works independently.

TodaCr.py is the orginal file that we used in the paper. 
The main difference with TodaCor_NoNumba.py is that in the former we do not use the library Numba.

The output of both files is the same.

Libraries:

Numpy
Scipy
Numba, just for TodaCor.py

Comments are welcome
